Uses various services to grab specific kills made by high-value targets in the video game Eve Online and post them to a discord channel.

The discord bot framework is discord.py, the bot pulls kill information using the zkillboard.com websocket and Eve Online's RESTful API called ESI is used to filter those kills.
